# The Therapy Failures - Accidental Villains

## Concept
NPCs who sought help from Faris but were psychologically damaged by failed dream therapy, becoming villains.

## Examples

### The Nightmare Baron
- **Original Issue**: Simple phobia of spiders
- **Failed Treatment**: Nat 1 caused spider phobia to consume identity
- **Current State**: Believes reality is web of lies, spreads paranoia
- **Powers**: Summons nightmare spiders, web of madness

### Lady Regression  
- **Original Issue**: Childhood trauma
- **Failed Treatment**: Trapped in child mindset with adult power
- **Current State**: Turns others into children, creates "playgrounds"
- **Powers**: Age manipulation, reality becomes childish

### The Void Walker
- **Original Issue**: Existential anxiety
- **Failed Treatment**: Lost all sense of meaning/purpose
- **Current State**: Spreads nihilistic emptiness
- **Powers**: Drains motivation, creates apathy zones

### Mirror Mind
- **Original Issue**: Low self-esteem
- **Failed Treatment**: Fractured into multiple conflicting selves
- **Current State**: Creates identity crises in others
- **Powers**: Personality splitting, mirror dimensions

## Pattern
1. Sought help for manageable issue
2. [[Faris - Kalashtar Sorcerer|Faris]] rolled poorly during treatment
3. Issue became core identity
4. Now spread their condition to others

## Role in Campaign
- Recurring antagonists
- [[Faris - Kalashtar Sorcerer|Faris]] feels responsible
- Can they be healed properly?
- Show consequences of PC actions

>[!warning] Therapeutic Ethics
>Each villain represents the cost of failure in [[Dream Plane Matrix|dream therapy]]. Can they be saved?
