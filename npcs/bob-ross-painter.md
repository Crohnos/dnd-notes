- **"Mechanical Precision"**: Portal to [[plane-mechanus.md|Mechanus]] - clockwork realm access

### Portal Mechanics - Quantum Technology

- **Quantumbot Integration**: Microscopic bots respond to artistic intention and divine/technological will
- **Stability**: Permanent wormhole anchors unless quantum field disrupted
- **Size Limitation**: Medium creatures or smaller (quantum field constraints)

### Portal Restrictions

- **Feywild Constraint**: Can enter but cannot travel far from portal entry point
- **Quantum Interference**: Some areas resist quantum manipulation
- **Artistic Requirement**: Must paint with genuine inspiration for quantum response
- **Divine Permission**: Some realms require benevolent intent for access
