# "Moonwhisper" - The False Druid

## The Deception
Claims to be a Circle of the Moon druid who wild shapes into a wolf. Actually a werewolf pretending to be a druid.

## Cover Story
- "I'm just wild shaping!"
- "It's a permanent wild shape experiment"
- "My circle specializes in lycanthrope forms"
- Carries fake druidic focus

## True Goal
- Secretly trying to infect others
- Specifically targeting Denisse
- Wants to create "double werewolf"
- Building secret werewolf pack

## Behaviors
- Overly enthusiastic about full moons
- "Accidentally" bites in "wild shape"
- Pushes for nighttime activities
- Strange hunger during conversations

## Red Flags
- Can't cast other druid spells well
- Wolf form has wrong stats
- Doesn't know druidic customs
- Too interested in PC blood types

## The Pack
- Already infected several "students"
- Pack pretends to be druid circle
- Planning something during [[The Chromatic Convergence|convergence]]

>[!danger] Double Werewolf Risk
>If [[Denisse - Elf Druid|Denisse]] is bitten while in wolf form, what happens? A "double werewolf"?
