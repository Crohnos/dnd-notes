# Feywild Guards - Animal Races

## The Truth
All animal-based races (tortles, aarakocra, tabaxi, etc.) were genetically engineered as guardians for dimensional rifts. (See [[Genetic Engineering Origins]])

## Purpose
- Guard portals to other planes
- Prevent unauthorized travel
- Don't know their true purpose
- Think they evolved naturally

## Common Traits
- Natural armor or defenses
- Enhanced senses
- Territorial instincts
- Drawn to planar boundaries

## Specific Races
### Tortles
- Shell = dimensional shielding
- Long life to maintain posts
- [[Kyle - Tortle Bard|Kyle's]] connection

### Lizardfolk/Chameleonfolk
- Camouflage for hidden guards
- Temperature resistance
- [[Nathan - Chameleonfolk Artificer|Nathan's]] variant

### Others
- Each designed for specific environments
- Abilities match their guard posts

## The Feywild Connection
- Highest concentration near [[The Feywild - The First Tear|Feywild]]
- Feywild = major dimensional tear
- Some gaining fey characteristics

## Connected Elements
### PCs
- [[Kyle - Tortle Bard|Kyle]]: Tortle guardian heritage
- [[Nathan - Chameleonfolk Artificer|Nathan]]: Specialized variant
- [[Denisse - Elf Druid|Denisse]]: Lives near [[The Feywild - The First Tear|Feywild]] entrance
