# Feywild Borderlands

> [[continent-primordis]] > Feywild Borderlands

## Overview
Northern forest region where the Feywild bleeds into the material plane. Home to Denisse's people and site of the First Tear dimensional rift.

## Description
Ancient forests that shift between material and fey aspects. Trees sometimes move, paths change nightly, and the boundaries of reality are suggestions rather than rules. Wildlife includes both natural and fey creatures.

## Contains

- **[[settlement-wolfhome]]**: Denisse's birthplace (now mostly abandoned)
- **[[landmark-the-first-tear]]**: The dimensional rift to Feywild

- **Fey Courts**: Extending influence through rift
- **[[Feywild Guards - Animal Races]]**: Patrol borders

- **Prophetic Springs**: Water grants visions

## Plot Hooks
