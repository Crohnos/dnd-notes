# Moonwhisper's Lair

> [[continent-primordis]] > [[region-feywild-borderlands]] > Moonwhisper's Lair

## Overview
Hidden werewolf den where "Moonwhisper" the False Druid conducts his corrupted nature rituals. Poses extreme danger to Denisse due to double werewolf risk. Located in caves beneath an ancient grove.

## Description
What appears to be a sacred druid grove hides a network of caves below. The trees above are twisted into unnatural shapes, and the moon always seems full here regardless of actual phase. The scent of wet fur and blood permeates the area.
