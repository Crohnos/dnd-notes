# Somnara Institute

> [[continent-primordis]] > [[region-feywild-borderlands]] > [[city-dreamhaven]] > [[district-therapy-quarter]] > Somnara Institute

## Overview
The premier dream therapy training facility in Dreamhaven. Where Faris learned his techniques before his catastrophic failures led to his departure. Still the most respected institution despite recent scandals.

## Description
A spiral tower that seems to twist into itself, designed to mirror the recursive nature of dreams. The exterior shifts color based on the collective emotional state of those inside. Windows show different scenes depending on viewing angleâ€”sometimes classrooms, sometimes therapy sessions, sometimes pure dreamscapes.
