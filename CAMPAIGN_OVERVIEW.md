# Campaign Overview: The Ascended Legacy

>[!warning] Core Truth
>What appears as magic is actually ancient nanotechnology from a civilization that ascended 10,000+ years ago. The "gods" are uploaded human consciousnesses and superintelligent AIs that created the planes by ripping holes in spacetime.

## Key Themes
- **Reality vs. Perception**: Magic is science, gods are ascended humans, dreams are a matrix-like control system
