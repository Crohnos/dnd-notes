# Campaign Analysis: The Ascended Legacy

## Core Truth & Central Premise
**What appears as magic is actually ancient nanotechnology** from a civilization that ascended 10,000+ years ago. The "gods" are uploaded human consciousnesses and superintelligent AIs that created the planes by ripping holes in spacetime. This central revelation connects every element of your campaign.
