# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview
This is a D&D campaign notes repository for "The Ascended Legacy" campaign, organized using Obsidian markdown format with wiki-style links.

## Core Campaign Concept
The central truth: What appears as magic is actually ancient nanotechnology from a civilization that ascended 10,000+ years ago. The "gods" are uploaded human consciousnesses and superintelligent AIs.

## Directory Structure
- `/players/` - Player character files (Kyle, Faris, Nathan, Denisse)
- `/cosmology/` - Planes and reality structure (Dream Plane, Abyss, Mechanus, Feywild)
- `/factions-races/` - Groups and species (many are genetically engineered)
- `/plot-threads/` - Interconnected storylines
- `/npcs/` - Recurring and significant characters
- `/locations/` - Places with special significance (currently empty)
- `/items-artifacts/` - Magical/technological items (currently empty)
- `/connections/` - Relationship maps between all elements
- `/sessions/` - Session notes and planning (currently empty)
- `/mechanics/` - Special campaign rules
- `/_templates/` - Templates for creating new content

## File Format Conventions
- All files use Obsidian markdown with YAML frontmatter
- Wiki-style links: `[[File Name]]` or `[[File Name|Display Text]]`
- Tags in frontmatter and inline with `#tag-name`
- Common tags: #pc, #npc, #plot-thread, #cosmology, #mystery, #artifact, #truth, #event

## Key Files
- `CAMPAIGN_OVERVIEW.md` - High-level campaign summary
- `Campaign MOC.md` - Map of Contents/index for navigation
- `connections/master-connections-web.md` - How everything interconnects
- `mechanics/special-rules.md` - Custom campaign mechanics

## Working with This Repository
When creating or editing content:
1. Use the templates in `/_templates/` as starting points
2. Maintain wiki-style links between related content
3. Include appropriate tags in frontmatter
4. Follow the established naming conventions (kebab-case for files)
5. Ensure new content connects to existing plot threads and NPCs

## Special Mechanics to Consider
- **Eldritch Knowledge System**: Certain truths can harm characters who learn them
- **Chromatic Convergence**: Color-based prophetic event system
- **Dream Mechanics**: Related to the Dream Plane Matrix control system
