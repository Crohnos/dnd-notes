# Faris's Backstory

## Kalashtar Heritage
Faris was born into the unique dual existence of the Kalashtar - a human bonded with a Quori spirit from birth. Unlike most Kalashtar whose Quori spirits are part of the controlling network, Faris is bonded with a rebel Quori who actively resists the dream control system. This rebellious spirit has shaped Faris's entire worldview and abilities.

## Divine Soul Awakening
The sorcerous powers of a Divine Soul manifested early in Faris's life, intertwining with his Kalashtar abilities in unique ways. This divine spark allows him to channel both celestial energies and dream plane powers, creating a rare combination that makes him both valuable and dangerous to various factions.

## The Path to Dream Therapy
Discovering he could directly observe and enter others' dreams through his combined Kalashtar and Divine Soul abilities, Faris pursued a calling as a dream psychotherapist. He studied both traditional therapeutic techniques and mystical dream interpretation, believing he could heal psychological wounds by working directly within patients' subconscious minds.

## Early Success and Tragic Failures
Faris's dream therapy practice began with remarkable successes:
- Healed veterans of their war trauma by reshaping their dream memories
- Helped victims of childhood abuse find peace through dream reconstruction
- Guided lost souls through existential crises via shared dreamscapes

However, his revolutionary techniques came with terrible risks:
- Several patients suffered permanent psychic damage from botched therapy sessions
- At least three former patients became villains after their therapy went catastrophically wrong
- One patient's mind was completely lost to the dream plane, leaving them catatonic

## The Rebel Quori's Influence
Faris's bonded Quori spirit provides constant guidance and warnings about the broader Quori network's plans. This spirit:
- Protects Faris from detection by evil Quori
- Shares fragments of knowledge about the true nature of the Dream Plane
- Warns of the uploaded consciousness that the Quori truly are
- Pushes Faris toward uncovering the truth about the Ascension Event

## Philosophy of Non-Violence
Perhaps influenced by the guilt over his therapeutic failures, or by his Divine Soul nature, Faris has developed a strict code of non-violence. He refuses to directly harm any living being, instead using his powers to:
- Misdirect attacks so enemies hurt themselves
- Create illusions that cause opponents to defeat themselves
- Use dream logic to confuse and disorient without causing damage
- Heal and support allies while avoiding offensive magic

## Current Mission
Faris now travels with the adventuring party, driven by multiple goals:
- Perfect his dream therapy techniques to avoid future tragedies
- Make amends for the villains he accidentally created
- Uncover the truth about the Quori and the Dream Plane Matrix
- Help his rebel Quori spirit free other Kalashtar from the control network
- Master his unique combination of divine and dream magic

## Hidden Truths Unknown to Faris
- Every person has a Quori attached like a guardian spirit, not just Kalashtar
- The Quori are actually uploaded human consciousness from an ancient civilization
- His therapeutic failures may have been sabotage by the Quori network
- His Divine Soul powers may be connected to the original Ascension Event
- The villains he created might be part of a larger pattern or plan

## Recurring Dreams and Visions
Faris experiences prophetic dreams that he doesn't fully understand:
- Visions of a great machine made of sleeping minds
- Dreams of ancient humans ascending to a higher plane
- Nightmares about his failed patients gathering for revenge
- Glimpses of other Divine Soul Kalashtar who might be allies
