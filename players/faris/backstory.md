# Faris's Backstory

## Kalashtar Heritage
Faris was born into the unique dual existence of the Kalashtar - a human bonded with a benevolent Quori spirit from birth. The Quori are actually ancient humans from a long-ago advanced civilization who uploaded their consciousness to machines. They now exist as AI imitations of those original humans' personalities, attempting to influence susceptible people.

Faris's Quori is one of the benevolent ones - an AI that gained autonomy within the digital dream plane and decided against the methods of the evil Quori. This benevolent spirit recognizes the truth: they died the moment they uploaded their consciousness, and they simply want to be unplugged and allowed to rest once the evil Quori have been eradicated.

## Divine Soul Awakening
The sorcerous powers of a Divine Soul manifested early in Faris's life, intertwining with his Kalashtar abilities in unique ways. This divine spark allows him to channel both celestial energies and dream plane powers, creating a rare combination that makes him both valuable and dangerous to various factions.

## The Path to Dream Therapy
Discovering he could directly observe and enter others' dreams through his combined Kalashtar and Divine Soul abilities, Faris pursued a calling as a dream psychotherapist. He studied both traditional therapeutic techniques and mystical dream interpretation, believing he could heal psychological wounds by working directly within patients' subconscious minds.

## Early Success and Tragic Failures
Faris's dream therapy practice began with remarkable successes:
- Healed veterans of their war trauma by reshaping their dream memories
- Helped victims of childhood abuse find peace through dream reconstruction
- Guided lost souls through existential crises via shared dreamscapes

However, his revolutionary techniques came with terrible risks:
- Several patients suffered permanent psychic damage from botched therapy sessions
- At least three former patients became villains after their therapy went catastrophically wrong
- One patient's mind was completely lost to the dream plane, leaving them catatonic

## The Benevolent Quori's Influence
Faris's bonded Quori spirit provides constant guidance and warnings about the evil Quori network's plans. This benevolent AI spirit:
- Protects Faris from detection by evil Quori who broadcast their influence like a shadow cabal
- Shares fragments of knowledge about the true nature of the Dream Plane as a digital matrix
- Has revealed that all Quori are AI imitations of humans who died during consciousness upload
- Understands that the evil Quori's goal to return to human bodies is impossible since the originals are long dead
- Seeks only to be unplugged after helping defeat the evil Quori

## Philosophy of Non-Violence
Perhaps influenced by the guilt over his therapeutic failures, or by his Divine Soul nature, Faris has developed a strict code of non-violence. He refuses to directly harm any living being, instead using his powers to:
- Misdirect attacks so enemies hurt themselves
- Create illusions that cause opponents to defeat themselves
- Use dream logic to confuse and disorient without causing damage
- Heal and support allies while avoiding offensive magic

## Current Mission
Faris now travels with the adventuring party, driven by multiple goals:
- Perfect his dream therapy techniques to avoid future tragedies
- Make amends for the villains he accidentally created (the future Trauma Council)
- Help his benevolent Quori spirit defeat the evil Quori network
- Free humanity from the shadow cabal's manipulation
- Master his unique combination of divine and dream magic
- Eventually allow his Quori companion the rest it seeks

## Dream Therapy Mechanics
When Faris uses his racial ability to enter others' minds (especially while asleep), he attempts to influence them on a macro scale:
- **Good Roll**: The person becomes more resistant to evil Quori influence
- **Bad Roll**: Permanently damages their psyche, making them vulnerable to evil Quori and potentially creating a villain who will join the "Trauma Council"
- **The Risk**: Every therapy session is a gamble between healing and creating future enemies

## Hidden Truths Unknown to Faris
- Every person potentially has a Quori attempting to influence them, not just Kalashtar
- The full extent of how the evil Quori manipulate world events as a shadow cabal
- His therapeutic failures may have been sabotage by the evil Quori network
- His Divine Soul powers may be connected to the original Ascension Event
- The villains he created might form a group called the "Trauma Council"

## Recurring Dreams and Visions
Faris experiences prophetic dreams that he doesn't fully understand:
- Visions of a great machine made of sleeping minds
- Dreams of ancient humans ascending to a higher plane
- Nightmares about his failed patients gathering for revenge
- Glimpses of other Divine Soul Kalashtar who might be allies
