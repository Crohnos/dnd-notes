# Denisse's Backstory

## Early Life
Denisse is a 400-year-old elf who has lived most of her life as a hermit in the wilderness. Despite her considerable age, her isolated lifestyle has prevented her from achieving the power typical of elves her age. Her early years were spent in a community near a portal to the Feywild, where she learned the druidic arts.

## The Stolen Child
One of the most defining and mysterious events in Denisse's life was having a child stolen from her by the Feywild - without pregnancy or birth. This traumatic event remains unexplained and has left a deep emotional wound. The child now lives somewhere in the Feywild, their fate unknown to Denisse.

## Hermit Years
Following the loss of her child, Denisse retreated into isolation, living as a hermit in the wilderness. During these centuries of solitude, she developed an extraordinary bond with wolves, to the point where ALL of her Wild Shape forms manifest as different types and sizes of wolves, regardless of what creature she's technically transforming into.

## The Lantern's Curse
At some point in her past, Denisse acquired or was cursed with a mysterious lantern that controls her ability to speak. She cannot utter a word unless the lantern is lit - a restriction that has only deepened her isolation and made communication challenging. The origin and true nature of this artifact remain unknown.

## Connection to Nature
Despite - or perhaps because of - her isolation, Denisse has developed:
- A profound connection to wolves, including a wolf familiar companion
- The ability to receive prophetic visions (often communicated through secret notes from the DM)
- An overwhelming love and protectiveness for all children, perhaps stemming from the loss of her own

## Recent Events
Something has drawn Denisse out of her hermitage and into the adventuring party. Whether it's a prophetic vision, a lead on her stolen child, or a threat to the natural world she protects, she has reluctantly rejoined civilization to face whatever challenges lie ahead.

## Unresolved Mysteries
- Who or what stole her child, and why?
- What is the true nature of the lantern that controls her speech?
- Why do all her Wild Shapes manifest as wolves?
- What prophetic visions has she been receiving?

## Hidden Dangers
Unknown to Denisse, she faces a unique risk: the possibility of being bitten by a werewolf while in wolf form, potentially creating a "double werewolf" situation with unknown consequences. The false druid known as "Moonwhisper" may be connected to this threat.
