# Denisse's Backstory

## Early Life
Denisse is a 400-year-old elf who has lived most of her life as a hermit in the wilderness. Despite her considerable age, she never cared to improve her strength and remains a low-level druid - highly unusual for elves her age who are typically very powerful. 

She unknowingly lived on the outskirts of a forest containing fey and portals to the Feywild. Throughout her life, she had accidental dealings with fey entities without realizing their true nature. Unknown to her, elves were genetically engineered by ancient humans to be long-lived, powerful guardians of these Feywild portals - remnants of humanity's early attempts at planar travel and ascension to godhood.

## The Stolen Child
Unbeknownst to Denisse, she would have given birth to a 'child of the forest' via immaculate conception - a miraculous druidic event. However, before the child could be born, a separate archfey stole it from her, and the child now lives in the Feywild. This traumatic theft has left a deep emotional wound, and Denisse may not fully understand what was taken from her.

## Hermit Years
Following the loss of her child, Denisse retreated into isolation, living as a hermit in the wilderness. During these centuries of solitude, she developed an extraordinary bond with wolves, to the point where ALL of her Wild Shape forms manifest as different types and sizes of wolves, regardless of what creature she's technically transforming into.

## The Voice Theft
Denisse had her voice stolen by an Archfey, who now rents it back to her daily. She can only speak during certain times of the day when the rental is active. Otherwise, she has a limited number of words she can speak before running out. If she goes over the limit, the Archfey demands interest, making future communication even more restricted. This voice-rental system has deepened her isolation and made normal conversation nearly impossible.

## Connection to Nature
Despite - or perhaps because of - her isolation, Denisse has developed:
- A profound connection to wolves, including her animal companion Reina, a wolf with black fur
- The ability to receive prophetic visions, usually only a short time before they happen
- An overwhelming love and protectiveness for all children, stemming from the loss of her own
- A unique Wild Shape ability where ALL forms appear as wolves (bear stats = dire wolf appearance, etc.)

## Recent Events
Something has drawn Denisse out of her hermitage and into the adventuring party. Whether it's a prophetic vision, a lead on her stolen child, or a threat to the natural world she protects, she has reluctantly rejoined civilization to face whatever challenges lie ahead.

## Unresolved Mysteries
- Which archfey stole her child of the forest?
- How does the voice-rental system with the Archfey work?
- Why do all her Wild Shapes manifest as wolves?
- What prophetic visions will guide her actions?
- How will the double werewolf transformation affect her?
- What is her connection to the engineered purpose of elves as portal guardians?

## Hidden Dangers and Future Threats
Denisse faces several interconnected threats:
- **Werewolf Pack**: An early enemy group that will target the party
- **The False Druid**: One werewolf will claim to be a Wild Shape druid who turns into wolves (like Denisse), but is actually a werewolf hunting for prey
- **Lycanthropy Risk**: Denisse will get bitten by a werewolf and contract lycanthropy
- **Double Werewolf**: After contracting lycanthropy, she becomes more powerful in wolf form as a "double werewolf"
- **Feywild Connection**: The portal to the Feywild is actually a space-time rift/wormhole powered by the quantum bots that enable all magic
