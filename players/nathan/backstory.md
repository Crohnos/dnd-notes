# Nathan's Backstory

## Noble Chameleonfolk Heritage
Nathan was born into one of the most prestigious chameleonfolk families, a lizardfolk variant genetically engineered by ancient civilizations. Chameleonfolk possess unique traits beyond standard lizardfolk:
- **Enhanced Perception**: Independently moving eyes for superior awareness
- **Adaptive Camouflage**: Color-changing scales for stealth and communication
- **Wall Climbing**: Adhesive pads allowing movement on any surface
- **Prehensile Tongue**: 15-foot reach for grabbing objects

His family comes from a culture of strict families with high community pressure to perform, emphasizing scholarly excellence and achievement. This noble heritage instilled in him:
- An unshakeable belief in his own superiority
- An obsession with aesthetics and physical perfection
- A deep understanding of his race's engineered nature
- Access to resources and education unavailable to common folk

## The Chromatic Convergence Opportunity
Nathan is aware of the Chromatic Convergence, an event where all colors of the world are being corrupted and changed. Unlike the colorblind seers who prophesy about it, Nathan sees it as a scientific opportunity. With good dice rolls, he can take advantage of this event to change his body's color at will beyond normal chameleonfolk abilities. He believes:
- The Convergence represents a fundamental shift in chromatic physics
- He can manipulate the color corruption for his research
- This event might be key to achieving immortality
- His enhanced color-changing during the Convergence proves his superiority

## College of Alchemy Professor
Nathan attended and graduated from the College of Alchemy, and now serves as a professor there. His academic career reinforced his existing biases:
- Convinced him that only STEM fields represent "real" education
- Taught him the theoretical frameworks for achieving immortality
- Connected him with the College's research bounty tier system
- Made him insufferably elitist about academic credentials

As a professor, he has:
- A rival alchemist colleague who competes for recognition
- Access to the College's extensive resources
- Pressure from the Dean/Board of Directors who secretly want him to find immortality
- Been tasked with making a scientific discovery worthy of tenure

## The Aesthetic Obsession
Nathan has developed an extreme fixation on physical perfection:
- Maintains a jacked, muscular physique through 'performance-enhancing' potions
- Uses his color-changing abilities to always appear in optimal lighting
- Developed his own line of alchemical supplements for physical enhancement
- Became convinced that physical perfection is tied to achieving immortality
- Views less physically perfect beings with barely concealed disgust

This obsession extends to his work, where every potion must be the perfect color, every formula elegantly written, and every experiment aesthetically pleasing.

## The Immortality Quest
Nathan's driving goal is to achieve legendary-tier recognition from the College of Alchemy by discovering immortality. His research has led him to believe:
- The Ascension Event holds keys to transcending mortality
- Chameleonfolk's engineered genetics contain immortality markers
- Perfect aesthetic form is necessary for eternal life
- The Chromatic Convergence might trigger species-wide immortality

He maintains detailed research notes, constantly experimenting with:
- Life-extending elixirs
- Genetic modification potions
- Color-based magical theories
- Ancient technological remnants

## Social Awkwardness
Despite his noble upbringing and elite education, Nathan is profoundly socially inept:
- Cannot read social cues or understand sarcasm
- Constantly lectures others about their inferior education
- Inappropriately comments on others' physical imperfections
- Genuinely doesn't understand why people find him insufferable
- Believes his awkwardness is others' failure to appreciate his superiority

## The Path to Adventure
Nathan's superiors have tasked him with going on a journey to make a scientific discovery worthy of tenure. In reality, the Dean and Board of Directors secretly want him to find the secret to immortality. He joined the adventuring party because:
- Field research is necessary for tenure-worthy breakthroughs
- He has a list of 'research bounties' with tiered rewards (immortality is legendary tier)
- Ancient ruins might contain pre-Ascension technology
- Legendary ingredients require dangerous acquisition
- The College values practical results over pure theory
- Other party members serve as useful test subjects (though he'd never admit this)

## The Shadow in His Village
Unknown to Nathan, another chameleonfolk from his village follows him - an outcast who became a rogue thief/assassin. This individual's abilities work particularly well for criminal activities, and they bide their time, watching Nathan from the shadows for unknown reasons.

## Hidden Insecurities
Beneath his arrogant exterior, Nathan harbors deep fears:
- Terror that he'll die before achieving immortality
- Fear that his research is fundamentally flawed
- Worry that bard college might actually teach valuable things
- Concern that his aesthetic obsession masks deeper inadequacies
- Secret knowledge that his family's wealth, not his intellect, got him through college

## Research Methods
Nathan approaches alchemy with scientific rigor:
- Maintains detailed experimental logs
- Tests every potion on multiple subjects (when ethics allow)
- Cross-references ancient texts with modern theories
- Seeks patterns in chromatic magic and genetics
- Documents failures as meticulously as successes

## Relationships and Conflicts
His personality creates constant friction:
- Argues with Kyle about education equivalency
- Dismisses non-STEM knowledge as worthless
- Offers unsolicited advice about others' physical appearance
- Genuinely confused why people don't appreciate his "help"
- Sees other party members primarily as resources for his research

## Current Research Focus
Nathan is currently investigating:
- The connection between the Chromatic Convergence and immortality
- How chameleonfolk genetics might be modified for eternal life
- Whether aesthetic perfection correlates with magical potential
- Ancient alchemical formulas from before the Ascension Event
- The role of color in life extension

His ultimate goal remains unchanged: achieve immortality, gain legendary status, and prove his superiority to everyone who ever doubted him (which is everyone he's ever met).
