# Alyssa's Backstory

## Early Life - The Hermit Years

Alyssa was born to a changeling mother who had taken on human appearance and an orc father who couldn't distinguish between humans and elves. Her father, unaware of her mother's true nature, believed he was with a human woman. This union created something unprecedented in the current world - the first natural mixed-race being born in centuries or millennia.

Her early years were spent in isolation as hermits, with her mother keeping them away from the outside world. This isolation may have been protective, given Alyssa's unique nature and the rarity of half-orcs in general.

## The Abandonment

Alyssa's orc father eventually abandoned the family, leaving deep emotional scars. This abandonment became a defining trauma that shaped her self-perception and relationships. She developed a deep hatred for her father and what he represented - the part of herself she saw as monstrous or unwanted.

## Loss and Adoption

When Alyssa's beloved mother died, she lost the most important person in her life. The changeling who had raised her with love and care was gone, leaving young Alyssa alone in the world.

An elderly woman from a neighboring town took Alyssa in, becoming a grandmother figure. This kind woman taught Alyssa valuable life skills, most notably cooking, which became one of Alyssa's few sources of joy and self-worth.

## Meeting Kyle - Shared Dreams

Shortly after her mother's death, Alyssa met Kyle, another young person who would become her close friend. Together, they encountered a traveling musician who inspired both of them to pursue music. This shared experience created a strong bond between them and gave Alyssa a dream to chase.

## The Diverging Paths

As they grew older, both Alyssa and Kyle pursued their musical ambitions. Kyle's talent and dedication earned him acceptance into bard college, while Alyssa was rejected. This failure reinforced her belief that she was inadequate and that her only value lay in her physical strength and size.

## Current Life - Making Do

Unable to succeed as a bard, Alyssa found work that utilized her imposing presence and orc heritage - as a bodyguard and bouncer. Her large frame and intimidating appearance made her effective in this role, though it reinforced her belief that violence was her only useful trait.

Ironically, her terrible musical abilities became a source of income through "reverse busking" - people pay her to stop playing rather than to continue. This arrangement allows her to maintain some connection to music while acknowledging her lack of talent.

## Hidden Truth

Unbeknownst to the world (and possibly to Alyssa herself), she represents something extraordinary. In a world where different races are essentially different species that cannot interbreed, her very existence as a natural mixed-race being is revolutionary. Her changeling mother's nature made this biological impossibility possible, making Alyssa potentially the key to understanding how different peoples might coexist and even unite.

## Coping Mechanisms

Alyssa finds solace in:
- **Cooking:** A skill that brings joy and allows her to care for others
- **Cats:** Creatures that accept her unconditionally
- **Music:** Despite her lack of talent, she continues to pursue what inspires her
- **Her relationship with Kyle:** A connection to better times and shared dreams

Her guitar-weapon, crafted as a metal slab by the local blacksmith, symbolizes how she's had to adapt her dreams to her perceived limitations - turning her musical aspiration into a tool for her violent profession.
