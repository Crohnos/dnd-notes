# Alyssa's Backstory

## Early Life - The Hermit Years

Alyssa is the first natural-born half-orc in hundreds or thousands of years. In this world, half-orcs are normally their own subspecies who can only mate with each other, and all humans have been wiped out. Her unprecedented existence is possible because her mother was secretly a changeling who transformed into a human while mating with Alyssa's orc father.

Changelings were genetically engineered by ancient humans to mate with any race and can change any part of their genome at will. Most changelings have died out by the time of the campaign, which is why most 'evolution' has stopped. Her father couldn't distinguish between humans and elves and never knew his partner was a changeling.

Her early years were spent in isolation as hermits, with her mother keeping them away from the outside world. This isolation was likely protective, given Alyssa's unique nature as the first true mixed-race being.

## The Abandonment

Alyssa's orc father abandoned her at birth, unable or unwilling to deal with what he had created. He couldn't distinguish between humans and elves and never understood what his partner truly was. This abandonment became a defining trauma that shaped her self-perception and relationships. She developed a deep hatred for her father and what he represented - the part of herself she saw as monstrous or unwanted.

## Loss and Adoption

When Alyssa was young, her mother died of a form of 'super cancer' - a consequence of the changeling's flexible genome and constant gene editing abilities. The unstable genetics that allowed changelings to mate with any race also made them vulnerable to catastrophic cellular breakdown. The changeling who had raised her with love was gone, leaving young Alyssa alone.

A little old halfling lady near the village where she was born took Alyssa in, becoming a grandmother figure. This kind halfling woman taught Alyssa valuable life skills including cooking, and introduced her to two of her greatest loves: music and cats.

## Meeting Kyle - Shared Dreams

Alyssa grew up with Kyle in the same village, both of them outcasts in their own ways. They were both inspired by a legendary bard who passed through their village, sparking their musical ambitions. This shared experience created a strong bond between them and gave Alyssa a dream to chase.

## The Diverging Paths

As they grew older, both Alyssa and Kyle pursued their musical ambitions. Kyle made it into bard college while Alyssa did not - a pure difference in talent that still stings. This failure reinforced her belief that she was inadequate and that her only value lay in her physical strength and size.

Alyssa loves music and wants to perform, but has absolutely no musical talent. When she performs, it's so excruciating that it causes damage to others. People literally beg her to stop, and some even bribe her to cease playing.

## Current Life - Making Do

Unable to succeed as a bard, Alyssa works as a bouncer and bodyguard, believing that the only way she can be useful to others is through her brawn. She hates that her orc father abandoned her and sees her strength as both a gift and a curse - it's all she has to offer, but it reminds her of the heritage she despises.

Ironically, her terrible musical abilities became a source of income through "reverse busking" - people pay her to stop playing rather than to continue. This arrangement allows her to maintain some connection to music while acknowledging her complete lack of talent.

## Hidden Truth

Unbeknownst to the world (and possibly to Alyssa herself), she represents something extraordinary. As the first natural mixed-race being in centuries, her very existence is revolutionary. Her changeling mother's nature made this biological impossibility possible, potentially making Alyssa the key to understanding how different peoples might coexist and even unite in a world where racial boundaries have been absolute for millennia.

The extinction of changelings means that 'evolution' and racial mixing have essentially stopped in this world, making Alyssa a unique bridge between species that cannot normally interbreed.

## Coping Mechanisms

Alyssa finds solace in:
- **Cooking:** A skill that brings joy and allows her to care for others
- **Cats:** Creatures that accept her unconditionally
- **Music:** Despite her lack of talent, she continues to pursue what inspires her
- **Her relationship with Kyle:** A connection to better times and shared dreams

## The Guitar Hammer

Alyssa hits people with a great hammer shaped like a guitar. A sympathetic blacksmith made it for her because she kept breaking wooden guitars in frustration over her lack of talent. This weapon represents both her dreams and her reality: a musical instrument that's actually a weapon, allowing her to 'perform' in the only way she's truly capable - through combat. It's both a tribute to her musical dreams and an acknowledgment of her true talents.
