# Eldritch Knowledge System

## Core Concept
Knowing or seeing certain things causes harm/curses

## Examples
- Seeing Hounds of Tindalos (but dumb people just see "sick dog")
- Realizing world exists in [[Dream Plane Matrix|Slumbering Titan's dream]]
- Understanding true nature of [[Core Revelation - Ancient Legacy|magic/technology]]
- Learning about [[The Ascension Event]]

## Mechanics
- Intelligence saves to avoid comprehension
- Wisdom saves to avoid madness
- Low INT characters immune to some effects

## Connected Elements
### PCs
- [[Faris - Kalashtar Sorcerer|Faris]]: Risk when exploring deep dream knowledge
- [[Nathan - Chameleonfolk Artificer|Nathan]]: Research into immortality may uncover dangerous truths
- [[Kyle - Tortle Bard|Kyle]]: Too simple to be affected by some knowledge?

### NPCs
- Dense/stupid NPCs who are immune
- Scholars driven mad by truth
- Those who weaponize dangerous knowledge

### Locations
- Ancient archives with forbidden knowledge
- Places where reality is thin
- Libraries with censored sections

>[!danger] Warning
>Knowledge can be a weapon that cuts both ways. Some truths were meant to stay hidden.
