# Core Revelation: The Ancient Legacy

## The Truth About Magic
- Magic is actually nanobot/quantum technology from 10,000+ years ago
- Casting spells = manipulating nanobots
- Ancient civilization spread this tech before ascending

## The Ascension Event
- Ancient humans uploaded consciousness → became [[The Quori - Uploaded Humanity|Quori]] in [[Dream Plane Matrix|dream plane]]
- Others used different methods → became various plane inhabitants
- Superintelligent AI split into:
  - Aligned AI → [[Mechanus - The Aligned AI Collective|Mechanus modrons]]
  - Misaligned AI → [[The Abyss - Misaligned AI Prison|Abyss demons]] (artificial organic organisms)

>[!info] Evidence Trail
>The truth is hidden throughout the world for those who look carefully.
