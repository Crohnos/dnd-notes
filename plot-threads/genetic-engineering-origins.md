# Genetic Engineering Origins

## The Truth About Fantasy Races
- All non-human races created by ancient genetic engineering
- Elves, orcs, dwarves = human experiments
- Animal races (tortles, lizardfolk, aaracokra) = Feywild guards

## Feywild Guards
- Animal races engineered to guard dimensional tears
- Placed at portals to other planes
- Don't know their true purpose
- See [[Feywild Guards - Animal Races]]

## Connected Elements
### PCs

- [[Nathan - Chameleonfolk Artificer|Nathan]]: Chameleonfolk = specialized variant
- [[Denisse - Elf Druid|Denisse]]: Elf = early experiment

### Locations
- Feywild entrances (guard posts)
- Ancient labs (now dungeons?)
- Creation sites for each race

### Factions

- Those who know the truth
- Scientists continuing the work
