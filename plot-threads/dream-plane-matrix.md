# Dream Plane Matrix System

## Thread Overview

**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ Active - Building Tension  
**Thread Type**: Primary Cosmic Mystery  
**Threat Level**: Existential (Reality-altering)  
**Current Phase**: 1 of 4 (Discovery)  

Ancient humans uploaded their consciousness to create an artificial afterlife, which became the dream plane. This system now manipulates everyone's dreams like The Matrix, but only during sleep. Every person has a Quori attached as a "guardian spirit" - though most don't realize it.

>[!abstract] The System
>While you sleep, you are in their world. When you wake, you think you're free. But the connection never truly breaks.
