### Red Herrings & False Leads
- Xhorhas Dynasty blamed for cult activities
- Fake "Hand of Vecna" circulating as trap
- Prophecy about "chosen one" is cult fabrication
- Ancient order claiming to fight Vecna is actually front

## Consequence Tracking

### World State Changes
- **Magic Instability**: Spell failure chance near ritual sites (5%)
- **Increased Undead**: Random encounters include undead (20%)
- **Prophetic Dreams**: Long rests may include visions
- **Political Paranoia**: Social encounters more difficult (+2 DC)

### Player Action Consequences
- **Stopped warehouse heist**: Cult lacks components, delays ritual 1 month
- **Saved Ambassador Kaine**: Would have provided crucial intelligence
- **Ignored street preacher**: Was cult recruiter, cell grows stronger
- **Befriended Lady Blackrose**: Gain information network access

### Branching Paths
**If PCs focus on artifacts**: Cult advances political plot
**If PCs focus on politics**: Artifacts slip through fingers
**If PCs split party**: Both advance but slowly
**If PCs ignore entirely**: Adjacent city falls to shadow

## Campaign Integration Notes

This thread serves as the primary antagonist force that:
- Unites disparate party members against common threat
- Provides escalating challenges from Levels 5-15

- Sets up potential future campaigns (success or failure)

### Success Conditions
- Prevent 3 of 5 major rituals

- Players wanted cosmic horror elements âœ“
- Political intrigue important to group âœ“
- Connected to Critical Role lore âœ“
- Personal stakes for each character âœ“
- Multiple solution paths available âœ“
