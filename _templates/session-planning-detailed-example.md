### 2. Create a Strong Start

> **Opening Scene**: The party awakens to screams from the harbor. Through their inn window, they see an impossible sight‚Äîa ship made entirely of shadow sailing INTO the bay, passing through solid vessels like smoke. Dock workers flee in terror as shadow forms pour onto the wharf. The temperature drops 20 degrees in seconds.

**Immediate Choices**:
- Rush to help evacuation (Heroic)
- Investigate the ship directly (Dangerous)
