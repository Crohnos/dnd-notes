# Werewolves

## Overview
Werewolves are humanoids cursed with lycanthropy, transforming into wolves under certain conditions. They struggle between their human nature and bestial instincts.

## Physical Characteristics
### Human Form
- Appears as normal member of their original race
- May have slightly lupine features (elongated canines, excess body hair)
- Yellow or amber eyes in some cases

### Hybrid Form
- Humanoid wolf combination
- Increased height and muscle mass
- Covered in fur with wolf head
- Clawed hands and digitigrade legs

### Wolf Form
- Appears as large, powerful wolf
- Larger than natural wolves
- Retains some human intelligence

## Lycanthropy Mechanics
- **Transmission**: Bite from werewolf can spread curse
- **Transformation Triggers**: Full moon, extreme emotion, or voluntary
- **Control**: Varies from complete control to involuntary transformation
- **Cure**: Difficult but possible through magic or specific rituals

## Abilities
- **Shapeshifting**: Between human, hybrid, and wolf forms
- **Enhanced Senses**: Superior smell, hearing, and night vision
- **Regeneration**: Rapid healing except from silver weapons
- **Enhanced Physical**: Increased strength, speed, and endurance
- **Pack Telepathy**: Mental communication with other werewolves

## Culture & Society
- **Pack Structure**: Form hierarchical groups with alpha leaders
- **Dual Nature**: Constant struggle between civilized and wild sides
- **Isolation**: Many become hermits to protect others
- **Hunter or Hunted**: Either embrace the beast or fight against it

## Relationship with Druids
- **False Druids**: Some werewolves pretend to be druids who wild shape into wolves
- **Deception**: Use this cover to get close to prey or hide their nature
- **Detection**: True druids can usually sense the difference
- **Denisse's Risk**: As a druid who only transforms into wolves, particularly vulnerable to werewolf infiltration

## The Double Werewolf Phenomenon
If Denisse (who exclusively wild shapes into wolves) contracts lycanthropy:
- Would become exponentially more powerful in wolf form
- Combination of druidic and lycanthropic wolf powers
- Unprecedented magical/cursed hybrid state
- Unknown consequences for control and consciousness

## Notable Threats
- **Pack targeting Denisse**: Group of werewolves with unknown agenda
- **The False Druid**: Werewolf pretending to be a wolf-shape druid to infiltrate the party

## Cultural Impact
- Source of fear and superstition in civilized areas
- Some regions have specialized werewolf hunters
- Certain societies accept and integrate controlled werewolves
- Magic items and silver weapons developed specifically to combat them
