# Half-Orcs

## Overview
Half-orcs in this world are typically their own distinct subspecies who can only breed with other half-orcs. They are not true hybrids between orcs and humans (as humans have been wiped out). Alyssa represents the first natural mixed-race being in centuries.

## Physical Characteristics
- **Height**: 5.5-6.5 feet tall
- **Build**: Muscular and imposing, inheriting orc strength
- **Features**: Prominent tusks, grayish or greenish skin tones
- **Physique**: Naturally strong and resilient

## Standard Half-Orc (Subspecies)
- **Origin**: Ancient breeding between orcs and humans before human extinction
- **Reproduction**: Can only mate with other half-orcs
- **Population**: Rare but established subspecies
- **Status**: Recognized as distinct race, not true hybrids

## Racial Abilities
- **Darkvision**: Can see in dim light and darkness
- **Relentless Endurance**: Can survive otherwise lethal blows
- **Savage Attacks**: Deal extra damage on critical hits
- **Menacing**: Proficiency in Intimidation
- **Orcish Strength**: Natural physical power

## The Exception: Alyssa
- **True Hybrid**: Born from orc father and changeling mother (who appeared human)
- **Unprecedented**: First natural mixed-race being in millennia
- **Revolutionary**: Her existence challenges understanding of racial boundaries
- **Hidden Secret**: Her changeling heritage is unknown to the world

## Culture & Society
- Often work in physical professions (guards, laborers, warriors)
- Face prejudice from both orcs and other races
- Form tight-knit communities with other half-orcs
- Value strength and practical skills over artistic pursuits

## Significance
The existence of a true mixed-race being (Alyssa) represents a biological impossibility in the current world order, made possible only through changeling genetics. This could be key to understanding how different peoples might coexist and unite.

## Notable Members
- **Alyssa**: Barbarian who works as a bouncer, aspiring musician with no talent, first true mixed-race being
