# Changelings

## Overview
Changelings are shapeshifters genetically engineered by ancient humans to mate with any race. They can alter their genome at will, making them biological bridges between otherwise incompatible species. Most have died out by the campaign's time.

## Physical Characteristics
- **True Form**: Pale, almost featureless humanoids with subtle shifting features
- **Height**: Variable based on current form
- **Shapeshifting**: Can assume appearance of any humanoid race
- **Genome Flexibility**: Can alter genetic structure for reproduction

## Racial Abilities
- **Shapechanger**: Can change appearance and form at will
- **Genetic Adaptation**: Can mate with any humanoid race
- **Perfect Mimicry**: Can replicate specific individuals
- **Changeling Instincts**: Natural talent for deception and infiltration
- **Divergent Persona**: Can develop multiple identity skill sets

## Engineered Purpose
Created by ancient humans as part of their genetic experiments, changelings were designed to:
- Bridge reproductive gaps between engineered species
- Serve as perfect spies and infiltrators
- Adapt to any social situation or environment
- Preserve genetic diversity across species boundaries

## The Extinction
- Most changelings have died out by the campaign period
- Their flexible genome made them vulnerable to "super cancer" and genetic degradation
- Surviving changelings are extremely rare and often hide their nature

## Evolutionary Significance
- Changelings represent the pinnacle of ancient genetic engineering
- Their existence explains why "evolution" has largely stopped - without them, species cannot naturally interbreed
- Alyssa's mother was one of the last changelings, making Alyssa's existence possible

## Cultural Impact
- Often feared and mistrusted when their nature is known
- Many live their entire lives in assumed identities
- Their children may not inherit shapeshifting but can be true hybrids

## Notable Members
- **Alyssa's Mother**: Disguised as human, mated with an orc, died of super cancer caused by genetic instability
