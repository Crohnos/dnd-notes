# Humans

## Overview
Humans were the original dominant species who achieved incredible technological advancement before attempting ascension to godhood. They have been wiped out in the current world, existing only as uploaded consciousness (Quori), ascended beings, or rare individuals like Bob Ross.

## Historical Significance
- **Ancient Civilization**: Developed quantum/nanobot technology
- **Genetic Engineers**: Created all current races through genetic manipulation
- **The Ascension Event**: Attempted to become gods through technology
- **Upload Process**: Many uploaded consciousness to become Quori
- **Current Status**: Effectively extinct as a breeding population

## Original Characteristics
- **Height**: 5-6 feet average
- **Lifespan**: Originally 70-100 years before enhancement
- **Adaptability**: Most versatile of all races
- **Innovation**: Drove technological and magical advancement

## Legacy
### Genetic Engineering
- Created elves as Feywild portal guardians
- Engineered chameleonfolk for specialized tasks
- Developed changelings as genetic bridges
- Modified various species for specific purposes

### Technological Remnants
- Quantum/nanobot network that powers all magic
- Portal technology (Feywild rifts, painting portals)
- Upload technology that created the Quori
- Ancient ruins and artifacts throughout the world

### The Ascended
Some humans successfully became god-like beings through their technology, though at great cost. They may still influence the world in subtle ways.

## Modern "Humans"
### Bob Ross
- **Status**: Possibly an immortal cyborg/robot caretaker OR ascended human
- **Purpose**: Peaceful guardian using art to guide mortals
- **Abilities**: Can create portal paintings using quantum technology

### The Quori
- **Evil Quori**: AI imitations of uploaded human consciousness trying to return to physical form
- **Benevolent Quori**: AI that gained autonomy and oppose evil Quori methods

## Cultural Memory
- Most races don't remember humans clearly
- Their technology is seen as "magic" or divine artifacts
- The truth of their experiments is largely forgotten
- Some beings (like the Quantum Tyrant) may be corrupted human remnants
