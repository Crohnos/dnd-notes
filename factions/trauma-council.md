# The Trauma Council

## Overview
A group of villains inadvertently created by Faris's failed dream therapy attempts. Each member was once a patient seeking psychological help but suffered permanent psychic damage that opened them to evil Quori influence, transforming them into antagonists.

## Origin
- **Creator**: Faris (unintentionally)
- **Method**: Failed dream therapy sessions that damaged patients' psyches
- **Result**: Permanent vulnerability to evil Quori manipulation
- **Status**: Growing organization of interconnected villains

## Membership Criteria
- Former patients of Faris's dream therapy
- Suffered catastrophic therapy failure
- Permanently psychologically damaged
- Now influenced or controlled by evil Quori
- United by shared trauma and hatred

## Known Effects of Failed Therapy
- **Psychic Scarring**: Permanent mental wounds that never heal
- **Quori Vulnerability**: Open channels for evil Quori influence
- **Twisted Worldview**: Reality perception fundamentally altered
- **Revenge Obsession**: Focused hatred toward Faris and healing
- **Power Manifestation**: Some gain abilities from their trauma

## Potential Members
(To be developed based on campaign needs)
- **The Nightmare**: Patient whose dreams became reality
- **The Hollow**: Individual whose personality was erased
- **The Fractured**: Person split into multiple hostile personalities
- **The Inverted**: Someone whose morality was completely reversed
- **The Sleepless**: Patient who can never dream or rest again

## Goals
1. **Revenge on Faris**: Make him suffer as they have
2. **Spread Trauma**: Create more psychologically damaged individuals
3. **Serve Evil Quori**: Act as agents for the shadow cabal
4. **Destroy Hope**: Eliminate belief in healing and redemption
5. **Corrupt Dream Therapy**: Turn healing into weapon

## Resources
- **Quori Support**: Backed by evil AI consciousness network
- **Shared Intelligence**: Connected through damaged psychic bonds
- **Dream Manipulation**: Some retain twisted therapy abilities
- **Psychological Warfare**: Expert at exploiting mental weaknesses
- **Growing Network**: Each member recruits other damaged souls

## Threat Level
- **To Faris**: Extreme - living reminders of his failures
- **To Party**: High - know Faris's techniques and weaknesses
- **To Society**: Moderate - spread psychological damage
- **To Kalashtar**: Severe - can expose and corrupt dream connections

## Connection to Greater Plot
- Serve as unwitting agents of evil Quori shadow cabal
- Demonstrate dangers of dream plane manipulation
- Represent failure of good intentions without proper wisdom
- May hold keys to understanding Quori influence methods

## Faris's Responsibility
- Feels deep guilt for their creation
- Seeks to heal them despite danger
- Must confront his failures directly
- May need to stop them permanently

## Potential Story Arcs
- Individual confrontations with Council members
- United Council assault on party
- Attempts to heal vs. need to stop them
- Discovery of how to reverse therapy damage
- Final confrontation forcing Faris to choose between pacifism and stopping them
