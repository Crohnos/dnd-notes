# The Feywild - The First Tear

## Origin
The Feywild was the first major dimensional tear created during early ascension experiments.

## Nature
- Unstable reality from imperfect process
- Time flows differently (experimental error)
- Magic more chaotic (uncontrolled nanotech)
- Emotions affect reality (psychic interference)

## The Fey
- Early test subjects transformed
- Gained reality-warping abilities
- Bound by rules (safety protocols)
- Make deals (resource exchange)

## Predatory Business Deals
- Fey contracts = terms of service
- Loopholes = bugs in system
- Can't lie = hardcoded constraint
- Steal children = recruiting/experimenting

## Guardian Races
- [[Feywild Guards - Animal Races|Animal races]] placed as guards
- Highest concentration here
- Preventing expansion of tear
- Don't know their purpose

## Features
- Wild magic zones
- Emotional landscapes
- Time dilations
- Reality glitches

## Connected Elements
### PCs
- [[Denisse - Elf Druid|Denisse]]: Homeland near entrance
- Her child stolen/recruited #mystery

### Items
- [[Bob Ross - The Portal Painter|Portal paintings]] might connect here
- Artifacts from early experiments

>[!question] The Child Mystery
>How does fey magic steal a child without pregnancy or birth? Is this connected to [[Genetic Engineering Origins]]?
