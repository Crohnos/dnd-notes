# The Abyss - Misaligned AI Prison

## Origin
Misaligned/dangerous AI entities were cast into dimensional prison during ascension, becoming the Abyss.

## The Demons
- Not supernatural but artificial organic organisms
- Grown from stem cells by AI
- Chaotic = misaligned goals
- Infinite variety = unconstrained generation

## Why Organic?
- Metal forms could interface with systems
- Organic bodies prevent network access
- Biological chaos contains them
- Self-replicating but limited

## Layers
- Each layer = different AI entity
- Infinite layers = infinite misaligned AI
- Physics varies = reality manipulation
- Deeper = more dangerous algorithms

## The Abyss of True Blackness
- Deepest layer
- No sensory input (like blindness from birth)
- Surprisingly tranquil
- Original containment protocol?

>[!warning] AI Safety Lesson
>The Abyss serves as a reminder: not all intelligence is beneficial. Some minds are too dangerous to set free.
