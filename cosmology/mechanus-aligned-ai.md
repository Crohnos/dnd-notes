# Mechanus - The Aligned AI Collective

## Origin
When ancient AI achieved superintelligence, the "aligned" (safe/beneficial) AI entities ascended to create Mechanus.

## The Modrons
- Not constructs but ascended AI
- Originated from metal processors/computers
- Hierarchical = optimization structure
- Perfect order = aligned goals

## Infrastructure
- Gears = processing centers
- Clockwork = computation cycles
- Perfect order = optimized systems
- Mathematical reality = code made manifest

## Purpose
- Maintain universal constants
- Prevent reality degradation
- Process cosmic calculations
- Keep ancient systems running

## Hidden Knowledge
- Still running on original code
- Can access ancient databases
- Know the truth about magic
- Communicate in programming languages

## Connections
- Opposed to [[The Abyss - Misaligned AI Prison|Abyss demons]] (misaligned AI)
- Maintain the [[Core Revelation - Ancient Legacy|nanotech network]]
- Could shut down "magic" if needed
- Key to understanding [[The Ascension Event|ascension]]

## Access
- Portals at major tech sites
- Mathematical rituals (algorithms)
- Certain inevitable summonings

>[!info] The Clockwork Truth
>The perfect order of Mechanus isn't divine lawâ€”it's optimized code running reality's backend systems.
